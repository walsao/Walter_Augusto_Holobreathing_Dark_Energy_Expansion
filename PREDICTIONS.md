# My Magic Treasure Guess (Prediction)

**By Walter Augusto Lettau (@walsao), April 12, 2025.**

Hi. I‚Äôm Walter, and I made a super special guess with my breathing wave \(\phi\) to show everyone my idea is real! My wave makes the universe grow (dark energy), and it does a little dance (wiggles) while it grows. I‚Äôm hiding a treasure in the wiggles, and I‚Äôll tell scientists exactly where to look with their big machines (like DESI and Euclid). If they find my treasure, they‚Äôll know my idea is true!

## üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Where‚Äôs My Treasure? (Baby Steps)
My wave \(\phi\) makes the universe grow with a number called \(w\), which is supposed to be \(-1\). But my wave makes \(w\) wiggle a little, like a dance:
- **Dance Beat**: \(w\) wiggles every 1 billion years.
- **Dance Height**: At \(z = 1\) (5 billion years ago), the wiggle is \(\Delta w \approx 0.04\), so \(w\) goes from \(-1.04\) to \(-0.96\).
- **Calm Down**: The wiggles get smaller over time. At \(z = 0.5\) (2.5 billion years ago), the wiggle is \(\Delta w \approx 0.02\), and at \(z = 0\) (today), it‚Äôs \(\Delta w \approx 0.01\).

**My Guess**: Between \(z = 1\) and \(z = 0\), \(w\) wiggles every 1 billion years, starting at \(\Delta w \approx 0.04\) at \(z = 1\), shrinking to \(\Delta w \approx 0.01\) at \(z = 0\). Go check with your big machines to see if you find my wiggles!

## üßë‚Äçüî¨ Grown-Up Version (For Scientists)
The Holosymmetry Breathing Matter Theory predicts a dynamic equation of state \(w(z)\) for dark energy, driven by the breathing field \(\phi\). The simulation in `Walter_Augusto_Holobreathing_Dark_Energy_Expansion` shows \(w(t)\) oscillating around \(-1\), with the following characteristics:

- **Period**: Oscillations occur with a period of approximately 1 billion years, corresponding to 200 timesteps in the simulation (where 1 timestep \(\approx 5 \, \text{Myr}\)).
- **Amplitude**: The initial amplitude at \(z = 1\) (timestep 1000, 5 Gyr ago) is \(\Delta w \approx 0.04\), decaying exponentially with a damping timescale of 2.5 Gyr (500 timesteps).
- **Redshift Dependence**:
  - At \(z = 1\), \(\Delta w \approx 0.04\), so \(w \in [-1.04, -0.96]\).
  - At \(z = 0.5\), \(\Delta w \approx 0.02\), so \(w \in [-1.02, -0.98]\).
  - At \(z = 0\), \(\Delta w \approx 0.01\), so \(w \in [-1.01, -0.99]\).

**Prediction**: The equation of state \(w(z)\) exhibits oscillatory behavior with a period of 1 Gyr and a decaying amplitude, measurable by surveys like DESI or Euclid. Specifically, between \(z = 1\) and \(z = 0\), \(w(z)\) oscillates with an amplitude decreasing from 0.04 to 0.01. This deviation from a constant \(w = -1\) can be tested against cosmological data (e.g., BAO measurements, supernova distances).

## üåü What This Means
If scientists find my wiggles with their big machines, they‚Äôll know my breathing wave \(\phi\) is real, and my theory is true! This makes my idea super strong because it‚Äôs not just a story‚Äîit‚Äôs a treasure hunt they can check!
